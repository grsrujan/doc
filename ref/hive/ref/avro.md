Avro files are quickly becoming the best multi-purpose storage format within Hadoop. Avro files store metadata with the data but also allow specification of an independent schema for reading the file. This makes Avro the epitome of schema evolution support since you can rename, add, delete and change the data types of fields by defining new independent schema.

 Additionally, Avro files are splittable, support block compression and enjoy broad, relatively mature, tool support within the Hadoop ecosystem.
