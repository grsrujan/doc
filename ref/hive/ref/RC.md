RC Files or Record Columnar Files were the first columnar file format adopted in Hadoop. Like columnar databases, the RC file enjoys significant compression and query performance benefits. However, the current serdes for RC files in Hive and other tools do not support schema evolution. In order to add a column to your data you must rewrite every pre-existing RC file. Also, although RC files are good for query, writing an RC file requires more memory and computation than non-columnar file formats. They are generally slower to write.
