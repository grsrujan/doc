JSON records are different from JSON Files in that each line is its own JSON datum -- making the files splittable. Unlike CSV files, JSON stores metadata with the data, fully enabling schema evolution. However, like CSV files, JSON files do not support block compression. Additionally, JSON support was a relative late comer to the Hadoop toolset and many of the native serdes contain significant bugs. Fortunately, third party serdes are frequently available and often solve these challenges. You may have to do a little experimentation and research for your use cases.
