ORC Files or Optimized RC Files were invented to optimize performance in Hive and are primarily backed by HortonWorks. ORC files enjoy the same benefits and limitations as RC files just done better for Hadoop. This means ORC files compress better than RC files, enabling faster queries. However, they still donâ€™t support schema evolution. Some benchmarks indicate that ORC files compress to be the smallest of all file formats in Hadoop. It is worthwhile to note that, at the time of this writing, Cloudera Impala does not support ORC files.
