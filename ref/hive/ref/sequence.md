Sequence files store data in a binary format with a similar structure to CSV. Like CSV, sequence files do not store metadata with the data so the only schema evolution option is appending new fields. However, unlike CSV, sequence files do support block compression. Due to the complexity of reading sequence files, they are often only used for “in flight” data such as intermediate data storage used within a sequence of MapReduce jobs.
