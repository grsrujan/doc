CSV files are still quite common and often used for exchanging data between Hadoop and external systems. They are readable and ubiquitously parsable. They come in handy when doing a dump from a database or bulk loading data from Hadoop into an analytic database. However, CSV files do not support block compression, thus compressing a CSV file in Hadoop often comes at a significant read performance cost. When working with Text/CSV files in Hadoop, never include header or footer lines. Each line of the file should contain a record. This, of course, means that there is no metadata stored with the CSV file. You must know how the file was written in order to make use of it. Also, since the file structure is dependent on field order, new fields can only be appended at the end of records while existing fields can never be deleted. As such, CSV files have limited support for schema evolution.
